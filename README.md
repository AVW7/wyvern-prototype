# Wyvern Prototype

A Phaser 3 scaffold for a two-layer game: an **isometric-background action mission**
with **sprite wyverns**, plus a **base/roster management sim** between missions.
Runs with zero art files — placeholder textures are generated at load so the shell
is playable immediately. Swap in real art and features as you go.

## Run it

ES modules need to be served over HTTP (opening `index.html` via `file://` will
fail with a CORS error). From this folder:

```bash
python3 devserver.py 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

`devserver.py` is stdlib-only `http.server` plus a `Cache-Control: no-store`
header, so edits under `src/` show up on a normal reload. Any static server
works (`npx serve`, VS Code Live Server, etc.), but with plain
`python3 -m http.server` browsers cache the ES modules and keep running stale
code until you hard-reload.

## What you'll see

1. **Roost** (base sim) — roster panel with one wyvern and a "Launch Mission" button.
2. Click Launch — the **isometric mission** loads: a diamond-grid map with raised
   tiles, and a wyvern sprite you control.
   - Move: Arrow keys / WASD
   - Attack: Space
   - Return to base: button top-right

## Where to add things next

- **Real wyvern art** → `assets/sprites/wyverns/` (README there has the exact steps).
- **Real iso maps** → author in Tiled, load in `PreloadScene`, build layers in
  `MissionScene` in place of the `DEMO_MAP` loop.
- **More actions** → add a state to `WYVERN_STATES` in `config.js`, register its
  animation in `PreloadScene.createWyvernAnimations()`, trigger it in `Wyvern.js`.
- **Sim depth** (training, building, resources) → the disabled buttons in
  `BaseScene` are the hooks; back the sim with `systems/roster.js`.
- **A second mission** → pass a different `missionId` from `BaseScene.launchMission()`.

## Design choices baked in

- `pixelArt: true` + `roundPixels: true` keep sprite pixels crisp.
- Iso rendering is manual (Phaser is screen-space): tiles placed via `gridToScreen`,
  overlap fixed by `sortByDepth` each frame. This is the standard Phaser iso pattern.
- Management UI is an HTML/CSS overlay, not canvas-drawn — far faster to build
  menus, rosters, and tooltips that way.
